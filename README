minecraft-init-script by Super Jamie <jamie@superjamie.net>

This is an initscript to run a Minecraft or CraftBukkit server on CentOS or Fedora.

## Features ##

* Start, stop, restart CraftBukkit as a system service
* Automatic (via cron) and manual logfile rotation
* Automatic (via cron) and manual backups
* Backup compression and rotation (keeps 7 days worth of backups)
* Check latest Recommended Build and update to it if required
* Information display including Java path, current memory usage, current TCP connections

## Features I'm considering adding ##

* Simplified backup restoration
* Log security alerts emailed to admins via sendmail/postfix

## Requirements ##

* CentOS 6, CentOS 5 (probably works on Fedora 12, 13, 14 too, maybe even Debian/Ubuntu/Mint?)
* screen, rsync
  (you'll need to install this)
* bash, chkconfig, coreutils, cronie, curl, diffutils, initscripts, net-tools, procps, tar
  (these should all be installed by default)
* Sun Java
* Enough disk space to save your map twice, plus another ~5 times for a week of compressed backup space. If your map is 1Gb then you probably need at least 7Gb, plus any space your plugins require and any additional backups you'll be making.

## Installation ##

As the root user:

* Install Sun Java
* If you are using Java 1.7, you don't need to configure alternatives in the next step
* If you are using Java 1.6, configure it as an alternative with something like
  alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/jre1.6.0_31/bin/java 16001
  then choose Sun Java with
  alternatives --config java
* Confirm your JVM selection with
  java -version
* Create a user with a home directory
  useradd -m bukkit
* Save the script as /etc/init.d/minecraft and make it executable
  chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft
* Allow the bukkit user to run the init script without needing root access
  Type `visudo` and add this line to the bottom
  bukkit localhost=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/minecraft*
* Create an alias so you only have to type "minecraft" or "mc" to run the script
  Add the following lines to both root and bukkit's ~/.bashrc file
  alias minecraft='/etc/init.d/minecraft'
  alias mc='minecraft'
* Add the service to chkconfig
  chkconfig --add minecraft
* Set the server to start on system start if desired
  chkconfig minecraft on

As the regular user, bukkit:

* Make the required paths
  mkdir -p ~/backups && mkdir -p ~/craftbukkit
* Put your craftbukkit.jar, world, plugins, server.properties, etc into ~/craftbukkit
* Create cron jobs to do regular backups and rotations around 4am
  Type `crontab -e` to open the cron interface and add the following
  0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup
  5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate
  15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups

## Usage ##

* Start the server
  minecraft start
* Stop the server
  minecraft stop
* Restart the server
  minecraft restart
* Back up the map and executable (the compressed backup is done when the .md5 file appears in the backup directory)
  minecraft backup
* Check the server is running with
  minecraft status
* Get some more info with
  minecraft info

  * CraftBukkit (pid 9037) is running...
